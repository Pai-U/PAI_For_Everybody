# Data layer Mining - Google Tag Manager for Web <br>
A data layer is a JavaScript object that is used to pass information from your website to your Tag Manager container.<br>
Sometimes the datalayer would not be installed like what marketing teams wish. That's why we need to provide a simple way for the marketing people in order to follow monthly the datalayer tags.

1.Title : title of the page<br>
2.URL<br>
3.Level 1 - 3 : Your datalayer levels<br>
4.Last modification : the last modification of your page if provided on sitemap<br>
